          <p><strong>How did you even get to this fucking site</strong></p>
          <p>There is no point on this site. I'm learning from scratch using the internet as a guide. You can't use this on your phone well. This will be updated forever, very slowly, almost like a digital part of my brain collecting references. There are 4 parts to this site.</p>
          <p>THE WORLD is a collection of places I have seen, that have left a positive or neutral mark that I'd like to digitally catalogue. 

          <p>THROUGH A SCREEN is a collection of things you can only see through your screen, which have helped to shape, entertain or touch me someway. As well as some I just kind of wanted to catalogue for no reason whatsoever, maybe for your entertainment. There is no real reason to some of the links that will exist on this page. 

          <p>RECOMMEDNATIONS um well this is a list of things people have recommended me or shown me. Some are their own creation, some are things that have imprinted on them and they desired to share with me at some point over the years I've lived. Now you can too explore these.

          <p>CREDITS it refers to crediting what has helped me to create this little website.</p>
