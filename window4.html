19/01/2018:
I am an antichrist
I am an anarchist
Don’t know what I want
But I know how to get it

09/09/2018:
I told you I was hurt
Bleeding on the inside
I told you I was lost
In the middle of my life
There’s times I stayed alive for you
There’s times I would of died for you
There’s times it didn’t matter at all
Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without
Standing in the dark
I can see your shadow
You’re the only light
That’s breaking through the window
There’s times I stayed alive for you
There’s times I would of died for you
There’s times it didn’t matter at all
Will you help me find the right way up
Or let me take the wrong way down
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without
Well I’m not gonna give it away
Not gonna let it go, just to wake up someday gone!
Gone!
The worst part is looking back
And knowing that I was wrong
Help me find the right way up
Will you straighten me out
Or make me take the long way around
I took the low road in
I’ll take the high road out
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without
I’ll do whatever it takes
To be the mistake you can’t live without

27/01/2020:
Even through the rain and fading light
Remember every word that you told me
Sing it out loud whisper it slowly
Just hold on cause daybreak is on its way
We used to run from all our shadows
And now we’re here to stay

27/02/2020:
Beneath all the pleasure, all you are is pain
And you deserve every second of your suffering
But yet I can’t stop, crawling back to your doorstep
Every time you beckon
I’m self-destructing, trust in nothing
Save me
You burn like a cigarette
I took my time to suck you in
So take me out of my head
And spread your ashes on my skin
Against the wall, we fall from grace
The pain we love is taking shape
A burning lust to touch the flame
Over and over again
We’ve played this role a thousand times
The same old script, just different lies
You disappear without a trace
Concealing the crimes on your face (crawl)
Your skin like winter
I felt you shiver
I heard you whisper
But the pills were quicker
I watched you wither
I am the killer
