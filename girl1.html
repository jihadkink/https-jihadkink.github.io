<h1>INVESTMENT IN THE SELF</h1>

<div class="content">
<div class="editable" contenteditable="true">

<p>The purpose of this page is to walk through how investing in yourself works. There is a notion that when a woman turns 30, she has 'hit the wall'. This idea that 'men age like fine wine and women age like milk'. I want to make it clear, I hate wine. I only drink vodka. And why the fuck would I want to drink liquid from the nipples of a random mammal which is only produced from pregnancy for the offspring? Ridiculous. 

<p>Additionally, I'm still in my 20s, but I see that most people don't take care of themselves, invest in themselves, and they look like shit. Male and female. This is to explain not just how I have invested in myself, but why these proves that there is no hitting a wall as investing in yourself is equivalent to investing in an APPRECIATING ASSET. Anyone who says like it's because of reproduction, firstly, this is the only life you will have. You are not a breeding livestock. You know what happens to dairy cows when they can no longer reproduce and give milk? They're killed. 
  
<p> The average lifespan is between 70s to 80s, that's 20-30 years after menopause. Also, the older a man is, his sperm quality causes birth defects and pregnancy complications. Sperm banks do not even accept sperm from donors over 30 usually. So, remove this lie from your head. 
Your twenties are the foundation for the rest of your life, not the highlight of your life. If it is, that's like the equivalent to having peaked in high school if you erode afterwards for the rest of the many decades you have afterwards.</p>
